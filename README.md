# student-rent-calculator
A program designed to aid students in calculating home monthly rent costs. This program accepts multiple cost inputs such as rent, 
utilities and yard maintenance, and also accounts for additional fees that are chosen by the user. 
Based on the number of people in the apartment, the calculator will evenly split the cost between the number of individuals or will charge a different cost per individual based on square footage of a room.
